        title:"The Burari Case",
        description:<div><h1>The Burari Case</h1>
        <p>The Burari deaths case was a terrifying incident back in 2018 where 11-members of a family in Burari, Delhi had killed themselves. Many call it to be a case of mass suicide. While very little is known about the case, the majority of the information stands baseless or unreasonable, as has been often portrayed by television media. A family with a deep inside story was revealed to the world in a much better way because of Leena Yadav’s documentary on Netflix titled, ‘House of Secrets: the Burari Deaths‘. Until a death in 2007, the Chundawats (familiarly called the Bhatia family), were like any other middle-class family, settled and focused on a better future. While many who viewed the family from the outside thought they had found consolation in spirituality, there is no one left to describe what happened behind the four walls of the Burari house. The present article highlights the much-discussed case from different angles and information that were available, so as to make the reader understand the story behind the closed doors of the 11-member family. </p>

        description:<div><h1>THE ZODIAC KILLER</h1>
        <p>The Zodiac Killer is one of America's most infamous serial killers. During the 1960s and 1970s, Zodiac murdered at least five people, often couples in secluded areas, near San Francisco. His first victim was Cheri Jo Bates. He wrote a confession about her, including a message to “beware…”

The media has been captivated by the Zodiac Killer because of his relationship with the media. Zodiac began sending coded messages taunting police to various newspapers very soon after his first murder. He signed these letters with a circle with a plus sign over it, his symbol. He infamously sent a cipher that said, “This is the Zodiac speaking. By the way have you cracked the last cipher I sent you? My name is…” This was followed by a series of 13 symbols that were supposed to be his name, encoded. To this day, this code has not been cracked.

The Zodiac Killer case remains unsolved. Although suspects have come forward - and continue to come forward, to this day - no one has been confirmed as the actual Zodiac Killer. Some of the more famous suspects include Arthur Leigh Allen, who was dismissed because of his handwriting sample, and Earl Van Best, Jr., more recently, who was accused by his son in a tell-all book, The Most Dangerous Animal of All.</p></div>,

        title:"THE TAMAN SHUD CASE",
        description:<div><h1>THE TAMAN SHUD CASE</h1>
        <p>A body was found on the shore of Somerton Beach. The man was not breathing. He was wearing a nice suit—a very formal wear—which was totally bizarre. No one knew who he was; he had no form of identification.

He was not one of the reported missing people. There was no clue who he was and the investigators just simply theorised that he died of natural causes while he was near the shore of the beach. It’s been more than 65 years people investigated this body over and over again but no one knows the answer to this puzzle.

It was seven o’clock in the afternoon, 1948, when a married couple passed by this old man’s body. They thought he was just drunk and so ignored and passed by. There was another group of people who passed by just a few minutes after, but they also ignored him. The next day, when the married couple came out to the beach once again, they realised that it was the same man lying there in the same spot. Suspecting that something was wrong, the married couple called 911 immediately.

The body was sent to Royal Adelaide Hospital and was carefully examined. According to the police, the following materials were all found in this man’s pocket: “an unused train ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach, a bus ticket from Adelaide to Glenelg, a pack of Juicy Fruit chewing gum, some Bryant & May matches, an aluminum comb, and a pack of Army Club cigarettes containing seven cigarettes of another, more expensive brand called Kensitas.”

</p>
<p>The autopsy that the doctors did the next day told several things. The doctor claimed that this man’s foot was oddly twisted, making the doctors predict that he often wore formal shoes like shoes with heels. Also, his liver was swollen and his pupils were smaller than normal. Doctors all predicted that this man was poisoned, but there was no poisonous substance found in his body, which surprised both doctors and the police.

Detective Sergeant Lionel Leane continuously investigated through everything he could but there were barely any positive outcomes. There was a clueless note in one of the items that this man had with him. This note, after investigators tried to solve it, came to conclusion that it meant “finished” or “ended”. What could this possibly have meant? How did this poor, unknown man die?</p></div>,

        title:"THE SEVERED FEET MYSTERY",
        description:<div><h1>THE SEVERED FEET MYSTERY</h1>
        <p>While walking on the beach, many people look out for a number of things: Shells, buried treasure, crabs, and dolphins among them. But if you’re on a beach in British Columbia, you might want to keep an eye out for something a little more sinister—about 15 severed feet have washed up on the shores there in the past few years. The latest was found on May 6, wedged in a mass of logs on Gabriola Island, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p>
        <p>The feet have been surprising unlucky British Columbians for over a decade. The first appeared back in 2007 on Jedediah Island; it was eventually matched to a deceased man whose family declined to provide additional information. Bizarre, but not particularly alarming—until another one showed up on Gabriola Island less than a month later. More feet followed, and though some were matched to missing persons, most remained anonymous (feet, unfortunately, don’t contain much identifying information). Instead, police focused on the fact that each foot was encased in a running shoe—though sizes, genders, and brands differed.

This seems like a real-life episode of The X-Files, but it turns out there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for the severed feet: They’re not really “severed,” which would indicate cutting or slicing, at all. According to scientists who tested the theory, the feet likely belong to suicide, drowning, or plane crash victims. It’s common for decomposing bodies to come apart at the joint, making it natural for the foot to come apart from the leg. But if that’s the case, wouldn’t hands be similarly susceptible to washing up on beaches? Nope, that’s where the shoes come in.</p>
        <p>While the rest of the body naturally decomposes in water, feet are surprisingly well protected inside the rubber and fabric of a shoe. The soles can be pretty buoyant, and sometimes air pockets get trapped inside the shoe, making it float to the surface. Most of the “severed” feet have been clad in jogging shoes such as Nikes and Pumas, but at least one case involves a hiking boot. In that instance, the boot (and foot) was matched to a man who went missing while fishing more than 25 years ago. The most recent case also involves a hiking boot.</p>
        <p>That leaves the question: Why British Columbia? According to Richard Thompson, an oceanographer with the federal Institute of Ocean Sciences, it’s connected to ocean current. “There’s a lot of recirculation in the region; we’re working here with a semi-enclosed basin. Fraser River, False Creek, Burrard Inlet—all those regions around there are somewhat semi-enclosed. The tidal currents and the winds can keep things that are floating recirculating in the system." Several feet have also been found further south, in Washington state, which shares a network of coastal waterways with British Columbia.

Others aren’t so quick to accept this scientific analysis, however. Criminal lawyer and crime author Michael Slade still wonders if a serial killer is afoot. "We also have to consider that this could be a serial killer," he said. "Somebody who right now is underneath the radar. That has to be on the table."</p>
